Comment: Based on the two visualisations:

1. IDW with `idp=1`: This interpolation produces a smoother distribution of precipitation values across Singapore. It emphasises regional patterns, creating a gradual transition in precipitation levels and reducing localised variations.

2. IDW with `idp=3`: This version emphasises localised variations, showing more distinct differences in precipitation across small areas. Higher `idp` values place greater weight on nearby points, resulting in a more "patchy" distribution, which highlights small, localised fluctuations in precipitation.

##### Which `idp` is more appropriate?

The choice of `idp` depends on the objective of the interpolation:

- If the goal is to capture broader, regional trends in precipitation, where gradual changes are expected over larger areas, then `idp=1` is more appropriate.

- If the goal is to capture highly localised variations, then `idp=3` would be more suitable as it shows sharper changes and highlights localised precipitation differences.

##### Practicality in the Singapore context

The context of Singapore, a densely populated urban environment with relatively small geographical area, capturing broader precipitation trends rather than localised micro-variations is more practical and useful for urban planning, infrastructure design, and flood management. Therefore, `idp=1` is the preferred choice for interpolating precipitation data in Singapore. 

Using `idp=1` provides a smoother, more generalised precipitation map, which aligns well with the need for a cohesive overview of rainfall patterns across the city-state. This approach reduces noise from small-scale variations, offering a clearer picture of regional precipitation trends that can be more effectively applied to large-scale decision-making processes in Singaporeâ€™s urban context.
